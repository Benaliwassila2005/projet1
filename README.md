Video Metadata Extractor

This project is a simple Python script that reads a video file and extracts basic metadata using OpenCV and the os library.

The program extracts and displays the following information:

Resolution (width and height)

Frames per second (FPS)

Total number of frames

Duration of the video in seconds

File format (extension)

It is a beginner-level project that shows how to use OpenCV to get video information.
